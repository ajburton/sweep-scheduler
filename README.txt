RRC Sweep Scheduler

The Sweep Scheduler is designed to automate the scheduling of daily rowing for those that sign up. 

It should allow a prospective rower to:
  - sign up
  - specify dates and times of availability for rowing, per week
  - allow the modification or updating of a profile
    -- email
    -- phone
  - remove a profile
  - deactivate a profile

It should keep statistics for each rower:
    -- skill level (beginner, novice, advanced)
    -- willingness to cox
    -- attendance (regular attendance, missed days)
    -- position (port/starboard/either, stroke)

Perhaps, keep statistics for each row?
    -- distance
    -- time
    -- satisfaction of each rower; ie "Like"

The application should also:
  - automatically email each participant either a URL or graph of their
    rowing assignment for the week (position; date/time)
  - make available a reminder system and be able to send email, sms, etc.
  - communicate with those who don't show up regularly with what would
    inspire them to come out
  - identify those who come out and don't come back (help with identifying)
    why they don't return
  - show a calendar and other helpful information
  - have information on what to do in case of inclement weather
  - have information on what to do if you are going to miss or be late for a row
    -- one button to click on to alert other rowers
